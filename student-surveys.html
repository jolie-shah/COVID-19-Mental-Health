        <p> To better understand the student's experience of COVID-19, it is important to gather informtaion from the 
          students themselves. While "The Statistics" segment compares how higher COVID-19 cases may correlate to higher 
          trends of youths with major depressive episodes, "The Student Perspective" will analyze survey studies 
          that reports the general impacts and reactions incited by the pandemic. "The Statistics" only displays the 
          numerical rise in psychological distress, so "The Student Perspective" would branch out to identify the key 
          impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that has triggered specfic emotions and changes in our daliy lives.

            COVID-19 on University Students in the United States</h4>
        </a>
        <p> 
          From mid-March to early-May of 2020, researchers gathered 
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245327">
          cross-sectional data from seven universities 
        </a>
          in the United States with 2,534 completed responses. After seeing how mental health hotlines in the U.S. 
          found a 1,000% increase during April 2020 and how several medical faciliates has had more suicide deaths than 
          COVID-19 infections, they were concerned at the most vulnerable population to the mental health crisis: 
          university students. College students face a large variety of burdens that are damaging their mental health, 
          ranging from managing their strenuous courses and worrying about the outcome of their futures to overcoming 
          financial concerns and social isolation. With the U.S. having one of the most expensive higher education in 
          the world and the lowest global recovery rate from infection during 2020, it is crucial to address the 
          mental health challenges that students are facing, as it could have long-term consequences on their health
          and education.

        <strong>Profiles + Risk Factors: </strong>
        <br>
        The researchers used vertical bar charts to visualize how each factor contributes to high, moderate, and low 
        psychological impact profiles. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Gender: </em> Women were more likely to be found in the high psychological impact profiles and less likely 
        to be in the moderate or low impact profiles, while men showed the opposite trend.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Age: </em>The 18-24 age group were more likely to be in the moderate profile, while the 25-32 age group
          were less likely to be in the moderate profile than the high and low profiles.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Race/Ethnicity: </em> Non-Hispanic Whites were more likely to be the low profiles, while Non-Hispanic Asians
        were less likely to be in the low profiles.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Social Class + Family Income: </em> Students reporting as being in the above-average social class were more 
        likely to be in the low profile, and students with below-average family income were more likely to be in the high
        profile.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Lifestyle-related Factors: </em>Students reporting to be in fair/poor health were more likely to be 
        in the high profile and less likely to be in the moderate and low profiles, while students with good/very 
        good/excellent health showed the opposite trend. Students spending two or more hours outside were less likely to 
        be in the high profile, while students spending more than eight hours on a device showed the opposite trend.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>COVID-19 infection: </em>Students that knew someone in their family/community who was infected were likely to
        be in the high profile rate and less likely to be in the moderate profile, while students who did not showed 
        the opposite trend.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>No Difference: </em> Researchers analyzed parental education achievement, parental social class, BMI, and
        exercise time, and these factors showed no difference. Profiles for non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic students
        also showed no difference, but the sample sizes were small.

        <strong>Conclusion: </strong> This study conducted a survey to thousands of students in the United States
        to analyze their reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students have reported a lack of motivation and feelings 
        of anxiety, stress, isolation, and worry due to COVID-19. They also found changes in their behavior, 
        like changes in socializing, changes in education, going out less, changes in exercise, and 
        changes in eating patterns. Researchers noticed that those who were women, 18-24 years old, non-Hispanic 
        Asian, below-average family income, in fair/poor health, and knew a person infected with COVID-19 to be the 
        profile of students who faced a high psychological impact of the pandemic.
